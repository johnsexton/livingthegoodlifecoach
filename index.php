            <h2>Meet Greg Furnia</h2>
            <p>“Because living the good life isn't about rank or title — it's about family, values, trust, and purpose.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content card">
            <img src="img/greg.png" alt="Greg Furnia, Life Coach, in uniform with his K9 partner">
            <p>I spent 26 years serving as a first responder leading teams, mentoring future leaders, and navigating the challenges that come with high-performance, high-stakes environments. It was a career built on purpose, service, and pride. But like many in this line of work, I learned that success at work means little if it comes at the expense of family, health, or integrity.</p>
            <p>That realization became the foundation of my next mission: helping others proactively build balance between who they are at work and who they are at home before burnout, disconnection, or regret take hold.</p>
            <p>I founded Living the Good Life LLC to prove that you don't have to give up one to have the other. You can be a strong leader, an exceptional professional, and still be a present spouse, parent, or partner. It takes communication, support, compromise, and revisiting your priorities often but it's absolutely possible when you lead your life on purpose instead of reacting to it.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've witnessed what happens when that balance is lost. I've seen families drift apart under the weight of stress, shift work, and silence. I've also seen what happens when people choose to lead intentionally, putting family first, strengthening their values, and redefining success on their terms. The difference is life-changing and it's why I do what I do.</p>
            <p>Before launching Living the Good Life, I served with the U.S. Border Patrol in multiple specialized roles, including the Horse Patrol and K9 programs both built on teamwork, trust, and the “family first” mindset. Earlier in life, I found that same sense of service and connection as a volunteer firefighter, and even before that, working in hospitality and entertainment cooking, serving others, and creating unforgettable moments as a wedding DJ.  Those experiences taught me to read people, build connections, and create moments of genuine joy.</p>
            <p>At home, family dinners were our foundation. Communication wasn't optional, it was the heartbeat of our household. Those values of honesty, presence, and laughter are the same ones I bring into my coaching and workshops today.</p>
            <p>Now, through Living the Good Life LLC, I help first responders, leaders, and families take a proactive approach to transition, leadership, and lifestyle, strengthening relationships and rediscovering purpose before the challenges become crises. My approach is values-driven, family-centered, and grounded in real experience not theory.</p>

I believe that in order for us to form the best team possible, we need to have a natural connection and share the same passion for working side by side to achieve our desired results.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Growth starts with connection and with a plan built around your personal retirement goals. This small, closed-group program is designed for first responders and their families who want a supportive space to strengthen identity and purpose, align as a family, and design a clear next chapter.</p>
                    <p>Across eight weeks, you'll work in a confidential cohort (6-8 seats) that blends guided discussion, peer resource sharing, real-life experiences, and guided reflection plus 15-minute 1:1 laser coaching between sessions to turn insight into action.</p>
