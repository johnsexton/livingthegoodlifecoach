            <h2>Meet Greg Furnia</h2>
            <p>“Because living the good life isn't about rank or title — it's about family, values, trust, and purpose.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content card">
            <img src="img/greg.png" alt="Greg Furnia, Life Coach, in uniform with his K9 partner">
            <p>I spent 26 years serving as a first responder leading teams, mentoring future leaders, and navigating the challenges that come with high-performance, high-stakes environments. It was a career built on purpose, service, and pride. But like many in this line of work, I learned that success at work means little if it comes at the expense of family, health, or integrity.</p>
            <p>That realization became the foundation of my next mission: helping others proactively build balance between who they are at work and who they are at home before burnout, disconnection, or regret take hold.</p>
            <p>I founded Living the Good Life LLC to prove that you don't have to give up one to have the other. You can be a strong leader, an exceptional professional, and still be a present spouse, parent, or partner. It takes communication, support, compromise, and revisiting your priorities often but it's absolutely possible when you lead your life on purpose instead of reacting to it.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've witnessed what happens when that balance is lost. I've seen families drift apart under the weight of stress, shift work, and silence. I've also seen what happens when people choose to lead intentionally, putting family first, strengthening their values, and redefining success on their terms. The difference is life-changing and it's why I do what I do.</p>
            <p>Before launching Living the Good Life, I served with the U.S. Border Patrol in multiple specialized roles, including the Horse Patrol and K9 programs both built on teamwork, trust, and the “family first” mindset. Earlier in life, I found that same sense of service and connection as a volunteer firefighter, and even before that, working in hospitality and entertainment cooking, serving others, and creating unforgettable moments as a wedding DJ.  Those experiences taught me to read people, build connections, and create moments of genuine joy.</p>
            <p>At home, family dinners were our foundation. Communication wasn't optional, it was the heartbeat of our household. Those values of honesty, presence, and laughter are the same ones I bring into my coaching and workshops today.</p>
            <p>Now, through Living the Good Life LLC, I help first responders, leaders, and families take a proactive approach to transition, leadership, and lifestyle, strengthening relationships and rediscovering purpose before the challenges become crises. My approach is values-driven, family-centered, and grounded in real experience not theory.</p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>I believe true success comes from aligning personal growth with professional development. My mission is to empower you to thrive in every area of life by cultivating integrity, empathy, and a family-first mindset.</p>

                <h3>Family First — The Foundation</h3>
                <p>When I say Family First, here's what I mean: it's a values-based commitment to the people who make you stronger—whether they share your last name or not. “Family” includes anyone who supports you, challenges you, and walks beside you as you build a healthy personal and professional life.</p>
                <p>Family First is also about being intentional with who you let into that inner circle—your closest support network, your “tribe.” These are the people you invest in, listen to, and protect, and who will do the same for you. In all of my programs, Family First is the foundation: we build a life and career that serves your family—however you define it—rather than sacrificing your family to serve your career.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Living with Purpose</h3>
                <p>Growth begins with reflection, clear values, and proactive action. I help you build balance and clarity before life forces change—so you can lead with intention and fulfillment.</p>
            </div>

                <p>I am going through the Border Patrol Academy which provides many changes, new opportunities, challenges, and experiences. Greg has been there to assist in showing me different perspectives and advantages/disadvantages to the many different questions and challenges I am presented with. He asks me questions which helps me think outside the box on potential options for myself will be more beneficial to me in the present and the future. I have never had a life coach before and I figured sense I had many “life based” questions than it would be worth a shot. It has been a great and extremely beneficial decision and I look forward to the meetings. <strong>-TA</strong></p>

                <p>After working with Greg just 3 times I felt as though there was a difference with my work-life balance. Greg is compassionate, professional, and attentive. I find that he uses his own life experience to relate, and that makes me feel understood. Through his listening skills, Greg will give you actionable items to either help improve your situation, or allow you to reflect and recognize the problem in the future. Lastly, he is there to help celebrate your achievements no matter how big or small. <strong>-GC</strong></p>

                <p>I was going through a difficult time after a 2-year relationship ended. I lost my partner of 30 years 3 years ago as well. I was emotionally drained and not feeling good about myself. I reached out to Greg, he helped me find the path I was looking for. The thing that impressed me working with Greg is that he poses questions, gave me exercises to do that made me think about what is important. Greg had me thinking again of my core values from there I am able to prioritize my life and decide for myself where I want to be. Greg is very easy to talk to, available when I need to reach out. So very professional. I highly recommend him as a life coach. <strong>-CF</strong></p>
